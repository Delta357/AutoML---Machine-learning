The work on BCG had started in India as a pilot project in two centres in 1948. In 1949, the BCG vaccination was extended to schools in almost all States of India. The International Tuberculosis Campaign (ITC) supported Government of India in expansion and scale up of BCG vaccination. From February 1949, five ITC teams demonstrated BCG vaccination in various urban centres with the start of a small scale pilot in Madanapalle. In a Conference in the summer of 1951 attended by representatives of the State Government, a proposal for the extension of mass BCG Vaccination Campaign throughout India was endorsed. The Government of India prepared a Plan of Operations laying down the organizational set-up required in each State to cover the total young population during a five to seven year period. The BCG vaccination was expanded through mass campaigns in 1951. The ITC support ended in June 1951 and from July 1951, BCG vaccination was conducted by the Indian authorities in close cooperation with UNICEF, which continued to provide financial support, and WHO, which gave technical advice31,32,33,34. In 1955-1956, the BCG vaccination mass campaign covered all the States of the Indian Union35. BCG vaccination became a part of the National Tuberculosis Control Programme (NTCP), which was started in 196232. The related events of this period were establishment of Tuberculosis Chemotherapy Center, later known as Tuberculosis Research Center (TRC) in Madras (Chennai) (now renamed as National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis) in 1956 and that of National Tuberculosis Institute (NTI) in 195932.

There were targeted efforts to control TB and the efficacy of BCG vaccine in prevention of pulmonary TB was in questions, since the very beginning. However, BCG vaccination was the only available protective measure against TB. A large BCG trial named ‘Feasibility Study for TB Prevention Trial’ was conducted in Chingelput, Tamil Nadu. This trial was started in 1968, recruitment and fifteen year follow up for all cases was completed by 1987. The trial showed that BCG vaccination did not offer significant protection against TB of the lung which occurs mostly in adults. After that, in India BCG vaccination policy was revised and it was recommended to be given at an early age preferably before the end of the first year after birth by integrating under UIP. BCG vaccination policies in many other countries were also revised as a consequence of the Chingelput trial findings36. This could be termed as a big success story of Indian research institutes in conducting large scale vaccine efficacy trial."

In 1928, small-scale production of BCG vaccine began in Mexico. In 1949, a BCG vaccine production laboratory was opened, and the vaccine was distributed throughout Mexico and Latin America [21–23]. Since 1931, the BCG Mexico substrain has been maintained by the Laboratorios de Biológicos y Reactivos de Mexico, a state-owned company that produces biological agents in Mexico. The BCG Mexico substrain was used as the vaccine seed for many years [24]. In 1970, this strain was replaced with the BCG Danish 1331 strain for vaccine production [25]. In 1998, BCG vaccine production ended in Mexico; since then, the country has depended on imported vaccine. These changes in vaccine production have caused confusion regarding the identity of BCG Mexico. For this reason, we characterised three representative strains used for BCG vaccine production in Mexico, which are designated BCG Mexico 1931, 1988 and 1997 according to the production period in which they were used. In this report, we describe the genomic and proteomic features of BCG Mexico 1931."

From the summer of 2009, only children with a mother or father from countries with a high incidence of tuberculosis receive BCG vaccine in the child vaccination program. Newborn children of parents from countries with a high incidence of tuberculosis should be vaccinated in early infancy. This will ensure high vaccination coverage in the target group and reduce the risk of the child being exposed to tuberculosis infection before the vaccine is given.
